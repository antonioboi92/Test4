This script is developed in Python using jupyter notebook.I used python because I think Pandas is a ideal library to manipulate CSV files.
In the first part of this script,I use Pandas function to order the words in the list and ,after that,I generate a new file CSV.Then,thanks
to the help of two empty list(a,b),I delete space between words and count the words in the list.In the end,I divide the sum of the letters
in the list by the number of the words in order to get the average word lenght.
