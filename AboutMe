My name is Antonio Boiano.I'm studing computer and telecommunications at the University of Cassino e del Lazio Meridionale.I will graduate 
in September.During the university,I studied C++,Python,Java,Assemby and I followed a six-month course in order to obtain Cisco CCNA R ans S.
But my dream is studying topics like AI,Big Data and Machine Learning.For this reason,I would be so happy to attend to this summer school.
